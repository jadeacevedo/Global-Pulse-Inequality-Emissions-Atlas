# Global-Pulse-Inequality-Emissions-Atlas
The Global-Pulse Atlas is an interactive analytical suite designed to help stakeholders visualize the dual-crisis of socio-economic inequality and environmental degradation. By layering GINI indices over CO2 emissions and population metrics, the project identifies regions where high inequality and high emissions create unique policy challenges.
